Welcome to my website! I am a third year Ph.D. student in economics and finance at Curtin University Bentley, Australia. I am interested in macroeconomics monetary economics and financial economics. My research has largely been in macroeconomics - broadly defined- generally exploring areas relating to economic growth/development, private capital flows and poverty. I have also worked on monetary economics by examining the effectiveness of monetary policy and international transmission of monetary policy. I have also worked research in financial economics using various econometrics techniques to examine asset prices. 

Before my Ph.D., I worked in industry as a an Economist (Country Manager) for <a href="https://tramontina.com" target="_blank">Tramontina</a>, managing the company's business in Ghana, Liberia, Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Togo. I also worked as a Economic Analyst for some trading companies in Ghana. I have a Masters in Economics from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and a Master of Philosophy in Finance from the University of Ghana where I had my Bachelors degree in Business Administration (Accounting).
